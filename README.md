# Desktop Application for Normalization of Fiber Reinforced Composites

Here is a simple desktop application to calculated the normalized values of uniaxial tensile/compression test data of fiber reinforced composites (FRC).
The raw test data after either uniaxial tensile or uniaxial compression tests must be normalized with a specific fiber volume fraction. The reason of this practice is to equally evaluate the mechanical behavior of FRCs regardless fiber volume fraction due to possible variations in different batches.

In this study, I practiced the use of PyQT5 for GUI creation, OpenCV for image analysis, SQL & SQLLite for database management after taking a course on Python 3 years ago.
